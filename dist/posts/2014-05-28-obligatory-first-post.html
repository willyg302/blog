<p>I&#39;m finally making the move from <a href="http://willyg302.wordpress.com/">my old blog</a> hosted on WordPress to this snazzy new Octopress. A few of the reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted on GitHub and backed by Git (yay!)</li>
<li>Markdown for everything</li>
<li>Shifting focus from game development to more general software development</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this is the start of something good.</p>
