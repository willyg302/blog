<p>To quote Joe MacMillan from <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, &quot;The computer&#39;s not The Thing. It&#39;s the thing that gets us to The Thing.&quot;</p>
<p>I sense another Thing approaching.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the idea behind <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> is nothing new. Although the relationship to lambda calculus is tangential at best, the analogy is a helpful one: these are functions. Containerized, distributed, aggressively managed functions, yes, but still <em>functions</em>. What else can you do with functions? <code>cat &quot;dog&quot; | grep &quot;Terrier&quot; | wc -l</code> perhaps? Or maybe even <code>thumbnail | compress | tweet</code>?</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://willyg302.github.io/blog/#!/post/2014-09-06-webs-and-streams">previously touched upon</a> the trend towards small applications that do one thing well, and am seeing it unfold through services such as <a href="https://api.blockspring.com/">Blockspring</a>, <a href="https://www.webscript.io/">Webscript</a>, and now AWS Lambda. What these services enable is an ecosystem of code-at-your-fingertips. Want to MD5 hash a file but can&#39;t remember which Python module to import? No problem, here&#39;s a cloud function that&#39;ll do it for you. Want to automate the terribly boring task of filtering your album of 1000 Instagram-bound images but don&#39;t have the slightest clue how to use ImageMagick? You don&#39;t have to worry anymore!</p>
<p>So we&#39;ve nailed the <strong>simplicity</strong> aspect of the Unix design philosophy; now it&#39;s time to work on <strong>teamwork</strong>. Having a piece of code in the cloud ready to be run at a moment&#39;s notice is cool, but what&#39;s really smashing is when you can start <em>combining</em> your functions. Imagine all the possibilities!</p>
<p>Lambda may seem like a lot of things to different people, but to me it provides a means for incredible innovation and an entirely &quot;new&quot; way of thinking about application development. It&#39;s the thing that gets us to The Thing, and I for one can&#39;t wait to see what The Thing is.</p>
