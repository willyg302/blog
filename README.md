# WillyG Blog

See it [here](http://willyg302.github.io/blog).

## Development

Run `strap run new_post` to create a new blog post. You will be prompted for the post title and a comma-separated list of categories.

Run `strap` to build the blog, then `strap run publish` to publish the changes to GitHub Pages. If you've only changed a post since the last publish, you can run `strap run rebuild_posts` to avoid rebuilding the entire blog.

## Todo

- [ ] Take the post `comments` metadata into account
