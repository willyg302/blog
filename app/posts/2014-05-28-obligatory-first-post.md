I'm finally making the move from [my old blog](http://willyg302.wordpress.com/) hosted on WordPress to this snazzy new Octopress. A few of the reasons why:

- Hosted on GitHub and backed by Git (yay!)
- Markdown for everything
- Shifting focus from game development to more general software development

Hopefully this is the start of something good.
