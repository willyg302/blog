For a while now users of GitHub have been able to [include emoji](https://github.com/blog/816-emoji) pretty much anywhere. The problem? There are [nearly 1000](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) to choose from, so which ones are actually useful for commits?

<!-- more -->

Naturally, the answer is "it's up to you." If you think your commit needs a ![cow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/cow.png) `:cow:` in it, then go right ahead -- I promise I won't judge (just kidding, I will, and *hard*). I have traditionally been very skeptical of any sorts of [sigils](http://xkcd.com/1306/) in software development, but anything can be good in moderation. Here are a few emoji I've identified as being practical for tagging commits, along with what they should be used for:

- ![apple](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/apple.png) `:apple:` For anything OSX-specific that is *not* in an OSX-specific project (otherwise there will be apples everywhere)
- ![confounded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/confounded.png) `:confounded:` Tag commits that leave trouble issues unresolved or are attempts to resolve a troubling issue
- ![exclamation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/exclamation.png) `:exclamation:` Highlights the importance of a commit, generally negative
- ![gift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/gift.png) `:gift:` A release commit
- ![lipstick](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/lipstick.png) `:lipstick:` Typos, rewording, or general polishing
- ![memo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/memo.png) `:memo:` Documentation-specific changes
- ![new](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/new.png) `:new:` For highlighting a new feature
- ![penguin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/penguin.png) `:penguin:` For anything Linux-specific that is *not* in a Linux-specific project (otherwise we'll have *Happy Feet 3* on our hands)
- ![poop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/poop.png) `:poop:` You're not proud of this code, and you should feel bad
- ![racehorse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/racehorse.png) `:racehorse:` Indicates that the commit is related to accomplishing some part of a sprint in agile development
- ![star](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/master/public/graphics/emojis/star.png) `:star:` A milestone commit

I'll be experimenting with adding some color to my commits in the coming months, and will probably expand this list as I discover more emoji.
